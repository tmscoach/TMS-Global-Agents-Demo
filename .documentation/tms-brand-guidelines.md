## The TMS brand is not just a logo.

It is the sum of all its visual elements, values, stories, ideas and experiences. Our brand toolkit is the collected visual elements we use to present the brand.

It is these visual elements and their combination that creates our unique style.

## Brand Presentation Guidelines

### Our logo

Our logo is our most valuable brand asset. It is the hook on which our brand hangs, the key visual mark that identifies who we are.

The coloured wheel is the essence of Team Management Systems (TMS) – the one thing people remember about the TMS products. The circle is a basic spiritual form representing the universe – the circle of life. As the wheel turns we get action and it delivers energy and results. Viewed from above the wheel invokes the image of the round table where everyone has a valuable contribution to make – the essence of teamwork.

The colours are particularly significant. Green is the colour of new life, of springtime, of new information and ideas. Yellow is the colour of the sun; when the sun shines we feel energized and want to get out and explore the world. Red is the colour of heat, of activity, of action. Blue is the colour of twilight at the end of the day; when we review what we've done and could we have done it better?

The other four colours are the intermediates.

When white light passes through a prism it splits into the spectrum colours. Likewise when the colours integrate they re-combine into white light. White is the colour of integration and co-ordination – the linking center of the Wheel.

It is important that we use our logos correctly and consistently so that our stakeholders always have the same brand experience. In the following pages, we have created some simple rules to help guide logo use.

---

### Clear space and minimum size

Our logo must be surrounded by clear space at all times.

This clear space ensures immediate recognition and maximum impact.

Outlined here as the clear space, this area defines the minimum distance allowed between the logo and other elements such as typography, illustrations or the trim edge of a printed item.

More space is desirable where possible.

The clear space area is calculated by measuring the 'Company name box' height and multiplying by two.

**Exception**
The exception is when there is a requirement to include either the TMS URL or the TMS tagline within the clear space designated area. In both cases the additional line of text should fit neatly into the height of the bottom box. This allows the TMS logo a clear space of 1x height from the base of the logo.

**Minimum size**
There may be times when you need to use our logo in a very small size. The minimum size our logo can be used is shown here.

- Minimum Size 35mm (Logo with Registration Symbol)
- Minimum Size 25mm (Logo without Registration Symbol)

Note – If the logo is to be used larger than 35mm it must include the Registration Symbol unless it is for social media purposes and special authorisation has been approved.

---

### Variations on backgrounds

Our logo comes in two variations.

The difference in the variations is the use of Black or White text depicting the Founding Fathers typography which is situated above the circle as a text arch.

When our logo is placed on a light background, defined as anything lighter than a 40% tone, the logo with Black Founding Fathers text should be used and when our logo is placed on a dark background, defined as anything darker than a 40% tone, the logo with White Founding Fathers text should be used.

When printing on material, the same theory applies.

In any case, testing must be done to ensure the readability of the logo as the texture of the material is a variable that can affect this.

If placing the logo directly onto an image, your discretion is needed. Look for areas of clear space or light tones. Please ensure the logo is always clearly visible and readable.

The logo needs space to breathe and should never be placed into a bounding box of any colour.

**This**
- If background is lighter than 40% tone, use logo with Black 'Founding Fathers' Text.
- If background is darker than 40% tone, use logo with White 'Founding Fathers' Text.

**Not this**
- Logo in a bounding box

---

### Inappropriate use of logo

Our logo has been carefully crafted to capture our core brand idea and must not be distorted or modified in any way.

Do not: reshape; reverse the layout; rotate or alter the logo in any way from the original; change the colour; crop too tightly to the edges, type or other neighbouring objects; run text too tight under the logo, i.e. website address; or place the logo over an image incorrectly.

**IMPORTANT:** Our logo should always be used as a whole with the inclusion of key elements such as the Founding Fathers typography (which is situated above the circle as a text arch) and the "Team Management Systems" wording.

The only exception to this rule is under specifically authorised circumstances, where a version of our logo has been created to work with the constraints of social media brand positioning. This will be discussed and approved on a case-by-case basis.

---

## Trade Mark Markings

### Appropriate use of trade mark markings

Our trade marks are protected and correct use of trade mark symbols identifies our trade marks as being protected.

**Do:** Use the ™ symbol in superscript.

**Do not:** use the registered trade mark symbol ® on any marks unless it is expressly permitted under this Brand Guideline or if you have been provided with a graphic by TMS which contains the registered trade mark symbol.

**IMPORTANT:** It can be a breach of laws to use trade mark symbols ™ or ® incorrectly. It is important to use them correctly to identify marks protected by TMS.

Example: Opportunities-Obstacles Quotient Profile (QO2™)

## Colours

### Our colours

#### Primary brand colours

The TMS primary colours are the eight colours used in the logo.

These eight colours are particularly significant.

Yellow is the colour of the sun; when the sun shines we feel energized and want to get out and explore the world.

Red is the colour of heat, of activity, of action.

Blue is the colour of twilight when we review the day, when we review what we've done; could we have done it better?

Green is the colour of new life, of springtime, of new information and ideas.

The other four colours are the intermediates.

## Brand Writing Style Guide

The purpose of this style guide is to ensure all those involved in the creation of materials, which promote, market or otherwise reference Team Management Systems (TMS) services or products, understand their obligations in how to present those materials.

This document sets out our style guide for the use of TMS brands, material or products and is referred to as the 'TMS Style Guide'. All persons involved in the creation of materials which promote, market or otherwise reference the brands, material or products of TMS must adhere to this style guide, which should be read in conjunction with other TMS policies and guides, in particular, the TMS Brand Guidelines. To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between this TMS Style Guide and the TMS Brand Guidelines, the terms of the TMS Brand Guidelines prevail. In this style guide, capitalised terms have the same meaning as the meaning given to them in the TMS documentation.

We are committed to providing services to the highest standards of professional and ethical care to clients and respondents. Adherence with TMS policies and guides provide clients and respondents with a cohesive and consistent experience when using TMS services. While the TMS Style Guide does not and cannot deal with every situation that may arise, the guidelines outlined below provide a baseline for materials.

The examples set out below are shown as examples only and are not used by way of limitation.

### General Guidelines

- Unless otherwise specified below, adhere to the British Psychological Society Style Guide to produce written material. For example:
  - Abbreviations should be spelt out on first appearance. A list of appropriate abbreviations is found in the table below.
  - Numbers from nine and below are written in full, while numbers 10 and above are written as digits. Exceptions to this are found in the following key terms; 2-way, 3-way, 4-fold and 8-fold.
  - Use commas in numbers of five figures and more: example of numbers: 3.71, 2500, 10,000 and 1,275,000.
  - Referencing style:
    - McCann, D.J., & Mead, N.H.S., (Eds) (2018), Team Management Systems Research Manual (5th Edition), Team Management Systems, Brisbane, Australia.

- Key terms relating to the suite of TMS products are always capitalised, whilst descriptive terms do not require capitalisation. A list of these terms is outlined in the following table.

- Words are only capitalised if referring specifically to the key term, proprietary brand or title; otherwise, the words are lower case. Examples:
  - 'Your TMP displayed a clear preference for an Analytical approach to Decisions.'
  - 'In the workplace, we may need to decide on the next step forward. One way to approach this would be to have an analytical approach.'

- For, 'accredited practitioner', use capitals if used as a title or proper noun, otherwise use lower case.
  - Example: "The TMP Accredited Practitioner, Peter Piper, has delivered many …"
  - Example: "… to become an accredited practitioner …"

- Electronic resources use a lower case 'e' with a capital first initial, e.g. eBook and eCoach

- Brands, logos, trade marks and common law trade marks of TMS must be used in accordance with the TMS Brand Guidelines.

- The words, 'profile questionnaire' and 'model', are only capitalised when preceded by the title. For example:
  - 'The Linking Leader Model …'
  - 'Your Team Management Profile Questionnaire has been completed.'
  - 'Your profile questionnaire has not been completed.'

### Team Management Profile

- Hyphens are always to be used for scale abbreviations
  - Example: E-I or P-C
- Role preferences are always hyphenated
  - Example: Reporter-Adviser or Explorer-Promoter
- The phrase, 'role preference(s)', must be used in its entirety; in keeping with TMS concepts, there is no 'role', rather, one has a 'role preference' or 'team role preference'.

### Opportunities-Obstacles Quotient Profile (QO2™)

- The term, 'QO2™', is to always have the trademark (superscript) displayed and subscript formatting applied to the '2'.

### TMS Global headings and Sub-headings

- For the purpose of clear instructions, terms can be in capitals and bold
  - Example: "You will find this document in the **Facilitator Resources** of your TMS Global Portal.
- The use of the words in a general sense, are in lower case and not bold.
  - Example: "There are many facilitator resources available to you to help plan your TMP programmes and workshops."
- Branded products are in capitals
  - Example: 'Advanced Reporting'
